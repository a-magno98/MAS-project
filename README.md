Abstract
    
The idea for the project comes from the pandemic situation we are still experiencing. I plan to simulate the spread of a virus in a network using the SIR model. There are three different states, S (susceptible individuals), I(infected individuals) and R(recovered individuals) and several parameters such as the disease transmission probability, the minimum amount of time a node remains infected, and the recovery probability.

The steps are the following:
- take a graph
- label all nodes as S
- define the model parameters (listed above)
- select nodes to start the diffusion of the virus, change the labels to I
- repeat the recovery until all nodes are in compartment S or R
The project's goal is to see how things evolve for different values of the parameters.
